# Market Sentiment Analysis
This program harvests news article data via API requests relative to given stock within the market. It then calculates the market sentiment based on lexical analysis and uses probabilistic models to evaluate a result.

The two text files, 'lexicon_sentiments' and 'stopwords,' are used in conjunction for both the filtering stage and to aid in the probabilistic stage of calculating sentiment.
